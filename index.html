    <h2>Legendary Fortress</h2>
    <p>On the walls of the magnificent Golubac fortress the “košava” wind breaks the waves of the Danube where the river is possibly most powerful, just before entering the largest gorge in Europe between the mighty Carpathian mountains.Like a sad, lonely Byzantine princess, like an eternal vigilant guard by whom no one can slip into the Djerdap gorge (eng. The Iron Gates of the Danube), the famous Golubac fortress has been defying centuries.</p>

    <h2>Reconstructed Golubac Fortress to open</h2>
    <p>The reconstruction and fitting out of the Golubac Fortress, a 14th century cultural and historical monument, kicked off
    in September 2014. Apart from the reconstruction, the project included an extensive archaeological research, which led
    to new discoveries that will complement the existing knowledge about the history of this medieval fort. The
    reconstruction was overseen by the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments in Belgrade, while the
    entire project was coordinated by the Austrian Development Agency.</p>

        <h3>By the way...Did you know?</h3>
        <p>The name of the fortress and the modern town in its vicinity can be translated as the "Pigeon city" or the "Dove city"
        (golub, "pigeon"). It is not uncommon name source in the Serbian toponymy, but the exact reason for the fortress' name
        is not known and only the myths of the origin of the name exist.Some sources use the descriptive method, as the "towers, like pigeons aim for the skies". The most popular, but
        obviously also much later myth, is that of a beautiful Serbian girl named Golubana. A local Turkish pasha fell in love
        with her, but she loved a young Serbian man and rejected all the proposals and expensive gifts from the pasha. Angered,
        he took her down in a boat and either imprisoned her in the only cone-roofed tower, or tied her to the rock above the
        river and left her there until she died.</p>
