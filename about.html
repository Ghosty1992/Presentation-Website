        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>Golubac, in the Braničevo District of north-eastern Serbia and on the modern-day border with Romania, marks the entrance
        to the Đerdap national park. It is strategically located on the embankment of the Danube River where it narrows to form
        the Iron Gate gorge, allowing for the regulation and taxation of traffic across and along the river. At the
        fortress location, the Danube is 6.5 km (4.0 mi) wide. In the Middle Ages, this was done with the aid of a strong
        chain connected to Babakaj, a rock on the far side of the river.</p>

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>Golubac consists of three main compounds guarded by 9 towers, 2 portcullises and a palace, all connected by fortress walls 2 to 3 m (6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in) thick. In front of the fortress, the forward wall (I) doubled as the outer wall of the moat, which connected to the Danube and was likely filled with water. A settlement for common people was situated in front of the wall. As is the case with many fortresses, Golubac's structure was modified over time. For years, there were only five towers.
Later, four more were added. The towers were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>From 803 to 1018, the area belonged to the First Bulgarian Empire, to the Byzantine Empire from then until 1193, and the
        Second Bulgarian Empire until 1257. The area remained in Serbian hands from then until the Ottoman conquest in the 15th
        century, with control of the region changing many times between Hungarians, Bulgarians and Serbs before then.</p>
        <p>Sometime between 1345 and 1355, Serbian Tsar Stefan Dušan toured the Braničevo region, which was part of Serbia along
        the boundary between Serbia and Hungary. He also visited Golubac, which was under the command of Castellan Toma, Voivode
        of Transylvania, under Hungarian control.</p>
        <p>By the time of the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Golubac was held by Serbia. It is unclear when or how it changed hands,
        though one source puts it later than 1382. After the battle, the fortress was lost to Sultan Bayezid I, marking the
        first possession by the Ottoman Empire. In 1391, Golubac switched hands twice. Hungarian Timişoaran Comes Péter Perényi
        won it, but shortly afterwards lost it again to the Turks.</p>
        <p>The years 1481–82 led to more fighting between the Hungarians and Turks. During the fall of 1481, while Golubac was held
        by the Ottoman Empire, Timișoaran Comes Pál Kinizsi undertook an expedition against the Turks in the Temes area. On
        November 2, 1481, he turned his army of 32,000 men south towards the Danube, pushing to Kruševac</p>
        Golubac was held by the Habsburg Monarchy between 1688 and 1690 and 1718 and 1739. Serb rebels controlled it during
        Kočina Krajina in 1788–91, and again from 1804–13, during the First Serbian Uprising. Afterwards, it fell back under
        Ottoman control until 1867 when it, along with Kalemegdan and other towns in Serbia, was given to Knez Mihailo of
        Serbia.
        <h4>In recent years</h4>
        <p>From the beginning of the 21st century, much of the fort has been overgrown, making most of the sections higher on the
        hill inaccessible. During the spring of 2005, a public project to restore the fort was started. Most of the plants were
        removed and certain parts, like the fountain in the moat raised in honour of knight Zawisza Czarny, were repaired. The
        walls, towers and stone stairs are in good condition, but the wooden floors and steps have rotted out, making most of
        the upper floors impassable. Golubac has also gained popularity as a tourist attraction. Two key reasons are the major
        road that passes through it, and its proximity to Lepenski Vir, making the two locales a touristic whole.</p>
